Fundamentals of Pricing

The fundamental drivers of cost

1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Data Transfer

Principles of pricing
1. Pay for what you consume and for as long as you use it with no large upfront expenses
2. Pay less by using more - realizing volume-based discounts.
There exists tiered pricing for services like (Amazon S3, Amazon EFS)

If existing pricing models do not meet customer needs, custom pricing is
available for high value projects with unique requirements

There exists services with no charges e.g Amazon Auto Scaling, However there might be
charges associated with other AWS services that are used with these services.

1. Pay-as-You-Go (On-Demand Pricing)
How it works:
You pay for compute, storage, or other resources by the hour, second, or request,
with no long-term contracts or upfront commitments.

2. Savings Plans
How it works:
You commit to using a specific amount of compute (measured in $/hour) for 1 or 3 years,
and AWS gives you a discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand

3. Free Tier
How it works:
New AWS accounts get 12 months free usage (with limits) for popular services like EC2
(750 hrs/month of t2.micro), S3 (5 GB), and Lambda (1M requests).
Some services offer Always Free tiers (like 1M Lambda requests monthly).

Total Cost of ownership
Is the financial estimate to help identify direct and indirect costs of a system.

is a framework to calculate the full cost of running workloads on AWS compared to traditional on-premises or other cloud environments.

It is used to compare the cost of running an on-premise IT Infrastructure to that of a cloud solution. This assists in making decisions about the optimal deployment
solution and budgeting purposes

TCO Components
For AWS, TCO generally includes three major categories:

Compute Costs

EC2 instances, Lambda, or container services.

Savings Plans/Reserved Instances can reduce costs.

Storage Costs

S3, EBS, Glacier.

Includes data retrieval, transfer, and request costs.

Networking Costs

Data transfer between regions, to the internet, or cross-AZ.

Hard Benefits

1. Reduced spending in compute, storage, network and security
2. Reduction in hardware and software purchases
3. Reduction in operational cost, backup and disaster recovery
4. Reduction in operations personell




AWS ORGANISATIONS

AWS Organizations is a service that helps you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts in your company.

Instead of managing each AWS account separately, Organizations lets you group accounts, apply policies,
and consolidate billing under one umbrella.

Key Features of AWS Organizations
Multi-Account Management

Lets you create and manage multiple AWS accounts.

Accounts can be grouped into Organizational Units (OUs) (e.g., by department or project).

Consolidated Billing

All accounts share a single payment method.

Volume discounts and Reserved Instance/Savings Plans benefits apply across all accounts.

Service Control Policies (SCPs)

Lets you set permission boundaries across accounts.

Example: Restrict certain accounts from using specific services (like EC2) or regions.

Account Creation Automation

You can automatically create new accounts using the API or AWS Management Console.

Helps quickly onboard new teams or projects.

Centralized Governance

Integrated with AWS services like AWS Control Tower and CloudTrail.

Helps enforce compliance and security across accounts.

AWS services can be managed through different interfaces:
1. AWS Management Console - Browser based
2. AWS CLI
3. Software Development Kits (SDK's)
4. HTTPS Query API
